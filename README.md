# Pharmacist Prescribing Tool

## What will the application do?
The application will allow pharmacists to efficiently prescribe medications 
for minor ailments in British Columbia.
Pharmacists can choose a minor ailment condition, 
access a list of medications recommended for that specific condition, and prescribe them to patients.
In addition, pharmacists will be able to modify the list of conditions 
and associated medications stored in the application database. 
Pharmacists will also be able to view and modify the list of medications each patient is taking.

## Who will use it?
Any **pharmacist** in *British Columbia* who would like to prescribe for minor ailments.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
Pharmacist Prescribing Services rolled out in British Columbia in June 2023. 
As a pharmacist, I found it time-consuming to look through guidelines and resources on what conditions 
I am allowed to prescribe for and what medications to prescribe each time a patient presents at the pharmacy. 
I hope this project will increase the efficiency and decrease the workload of a pharmacist.
